What is a Microcontroller?

"A microcontroller (sometimes abbreviated ÂµC, uC or MCU) is a <strong>small computer on a single integrated circuit</strong> containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a typically small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are <strong>designed for embedded applications</strong>, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications." (Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microcontroller&oldid=607593541">Wikipedia</a>)



Applications

Typical block diagram



Limitations

A uC ain't a PC!
Optimized for low power and size
Slow compared to a PC or a smartphone
No floating point unit
Little RAM
Sometimes not even HW multiplication



Our learning modules today

1. Hello, World!
2. Interrupts & Timers
